## Maximum and Mininum Number in a list

You need to get the min and max number in a list.

Your answer should be returned in an array containing the min and max number, respectively, as follows [min, max]

In cases where the min and max numbers are equal, return an array with just the number, as the first index [number]

Here are some examples

[1, 2, 3] should return [1, 3]

[1, 0, 8, 3] should return [0, 8]

[-1, -55, -2] should return [-55, -2]

[1, 1, 1] should return [1]

## How to Run this Lab

Clone the repository
Open index.html in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
Open js\max-min-number.js and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
You could refresh index.html in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.
## Notes

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
